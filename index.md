# The Imortality Project

## Welcome to my blog

Having kids and coming to the realization that I am going to die one day, I've decided to write down everything I can in the hopes that I can pass on my knowledge and experiences.  How and what we teach our kids is the closest thing we have to immortality.  I am starting this writing at the age of 44.  Even though I haven't had a remarkable life compared to the people you might see on screen or read in books, I do believe my life experiences so far can at least be a foundation for my kids to build upon.

More to come later...
